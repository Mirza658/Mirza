Iris Species Classification

Python project in Google Colab that shows how to build and test a machine learning model.

What it does

Loads the Iris flower data (150 flowers, 4 measurements each)  
Splits the data into “train” (70%) and “test” (30%) sets  
Trains a small decision tree to guess the flower species  
Checks how often it’s right (accuracy)  
Draws the tree so you can see its decisions  

Data

**Built into** scikit-learn (no download needed)  
**Features**: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width (all in cm)  
**Species**: setosa, versicolor, virginica
